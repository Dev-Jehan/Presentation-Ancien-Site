<i>What an exciting adventure Skyld embarked on by participating in the finals of the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) Startup Award! March 21st and 22nd, 2024, marked this competition that brought together the 12 most promising cybersecurity startups in Europe. It was a golden opportunity for our team to showcase Skyld among other talented entrepreneurs.</i>

<p>With immense pride, we were able to exhibit the achievements of recent months during this competition. We extend our gratitude to <b>Bochum Economic Development (Bochum Wirtschaftsentwicklung), in collaboration with the Women4Cyber Foundation and eurobits e.V. - European Center of Competence for IT Security (Bochum)</b>, for making this initiative possible.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) took center stage in discussions. Their increasing use in the field of cybersecurity opens up new perspectives, whether in creating educational phishing emails, automating penetration testing, or improving malicious event detection.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the importance of integrating security measures from the outset of any project was emphasized repeatedly. The recent adoption of the Cyber Resilience Act attests to the desire to promote a proactive approach to security from conception.</p>

<p>Although we did not win the coveted prize, this experience was an invaluable opportunity to meet investors, exchange ideas with other industry players, and strengthen our commitment to innovation and security.</p>

<p>The journey is just beginning, and we look forward to seeing what the future holds. Perhaps we'll meet again at the next trade show? Stay tuned!</p>
