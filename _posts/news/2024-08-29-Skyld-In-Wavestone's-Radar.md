*Skyld is proud to be listed on the Wavestone radar of French cybersecurity start-ups 2024 in the Artificial Intelligence category. With 168 startups and 42 scale-ups, the French cybersecurity innovation ecosystem is continuing to grow and is showing that it has successfully turned the corner on Artificial Intelligence (AI).*


For 10 years now, Wavestone has been updating its annual forecasting tool, the ‘CISO Radar’, which brings together all the key issues for the cybersecurity and operational resilience sectors.

**Here are this year's key elements**:

▶ **Expanding the ecosystem**: Partnerships between startups and large companies are multiplying, fostering innovation and the development of more robust security solutions. With 168 startups and 42 scale-ups, our field is booming!

▶ **AI in the spotlight**: Changing legislative frameworks are forcing cybersecurity players to adapt quickly, stimulating innovation and technical excellence. AI technology is becoming a central pillar in our security strategies.

▶ **Sustained growth**: Despite a slowdown in investment, the outlook for growth remains positive. And with the shortage of cybersecurity talent, many initiatives are being put in place to train the next generation of experts.

A big thank you to Wavestone and Bpifrance for this recognition, and a nod to all those who have supported us in this adventure!
