**The 9th Imagine Summit just came to a close!** Organized by _Le Poool and La French Tech Rennes St-Malo_, in collaboration with _Destination Rennes and Inria_, the Imagine Summit has established itself as the event to explore the latest innovations and projects shaping the Rennes ecosystem, our ecosystem.

This year’s theme, “**Desirable Innovation**” was perfectly aligned with what we do at Skyld, where innovation drives our mission to create reliable and sustainable AI.

**Here are the highlights of our day:**

-   The Skyld team, represented by Victor Guyomard and Mathis Mauvisseau, had plenty of **fascinating discussions** with talented innovators and key players in a dynamic and diverse ecosystem.
    
-   We had the honor of meeting **Nathalie Appéré, Mayor of Rennes.** We presented Skyld and our work in cybersecurity for artificial intelligence—a conversation that showcased how much local institutions actively support innovation.
    
-   Our CEO and founder, Marie Paindavoine, shared our vision during a **panel discussion on collaboration between startups and the Ministry of Armed Forces**, focusing on trusted and sovereign digital technologies.
    

The local innovation scene here is diverse and combines industries like tech, food, and manufacturing, all supported by a committed and encouraging ecosystem . **We’re proud to be part of it!**
