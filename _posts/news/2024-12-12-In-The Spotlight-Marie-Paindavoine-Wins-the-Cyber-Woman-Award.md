**On December 10th in Paris, women in cybersecurity were celebrated!**

We’re thrilled to announce that **Marie Paindavoine, founder and CEO of Skyld, won the European Cyber Woman Award in the Entrepreneur category.**

This award is a true recognition of our mission to bridge the gap between AI and cybersecurity. While AI is already widely used in cyber applications, the security of these algorithms is still an overlooked issue. Yet, they’re being applied in increasingly critical areas where trust and safety are key!

It was an evening filled with passion, talent, determination, and resilience—a chance to hear the powerful voices of women in the cyber industry.

**During the event, we were especially inspired by these talks:**

-   **Sophie Viger,** Managing Director at École 42 (engineering school specialised in coding) , who shared impressive data on the success of her efforts to bring more women into École 42, proving that it’s possible to move past the common excuse, “Women just don’t apply.”
    
-   **Leslie Fornero**, Marketing & Communication Officer at Stoïk, emphasized the importance of communication and marketing in cybersecurity during attacks, stressing that it’s time to start blaming the perpetrator, not the victim.
    
-   **Gabriela Belaid**, Founder and Chair of the Think Tank Le Cercle Olympe de Gouges, who spoke candidly about the challenges of gender diversity in tech. She stressed the importance of actions that encourage women to step up and the role of showcasing female role models. But she also pointed out a major issue: *54% of women in tech report experiencing sexual harassment, showing the need for change on the men’s side as well.*
    

**Congratulations to all the nominees and winners of the evening!**

And a special thank you to the CEFCYS team, led by **Nacira Salvan**, for organizing the 5th edition of the European Cyber Woman Awards and for their dedication to highlighting women’s talents in tech.
