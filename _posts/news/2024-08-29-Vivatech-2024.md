VivaTech opened its doors on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, and ran until May 25. This 8th edition brought together technology enthusiasts and innovators at Porte de Versailles, Paris.

Artificial intelligence was the main topic. So, the Skyld team was delighted to be there. 
The first day was full of highlights. 

▶ First, we had the honor of being present at the **DFKI booth**. A big thank you to them for their warm welcome.

▶ We were also privileged to receive a visit from the **CEO of INRIA**, Bruno Sportisse, who congratulated us on the progress of the company. 

▶ Additionally, it was a real pleasure to **meet HopeValley**, who believed in us for our first POC. It's always rewarding to see people who supported Skyld from the very beginning.

Thursday, we were chosen to pitch at the **European Deeptech Meetup**.  Skyld was one of 50 deep-tech start-ups chosen from over 200 applicants. The event supports start-ups in healthcare, digital, and industry.

Throughout the event, we were proud to be there with our **Brittany community**. Many booths showcased the region's ecosystem. 
VivaTech is the must-attend event for technological innovation.

*And if we missed each other this year, we hope to see you next year!*
