<p>The Halle de la Brasserie in Rennes was the stage for an event, the Creators' Morning, bringing together nearly 250 people. An opportunity to dive into the world of entrepreneurship and discover the startups created last year with the support of Le Poool. Among them, Skyld was distinguished as a nominee to pitch.</p>

<p>Founded by Marie Paindavoine, PhD, Skyld stands out with its mission to secure Artificial Intelligence algorithms embedded in phones and connected devices. This significant moment was marked by the presentation of the Audience Award, granted by the attending public.</p>

<p>This accolade provides Marie with the opportunity to showcase her achievements at the upcoming edition of Imagine Summit, scheduled for December 5th. A not-to-be-missed event, heralding a new milestone in the world of artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>The Creators' Morning allowed participants to delve deep into the startups emerging from Le Poool's support program.</p>

<p>Congratulations to us for this recognition, and see you on December 5th at Imagine Summit.</p>
