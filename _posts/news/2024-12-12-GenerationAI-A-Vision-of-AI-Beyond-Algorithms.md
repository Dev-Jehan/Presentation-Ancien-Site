***On December 3rd, our CEO Marie Paindavoine was at GenerationAI Paris 2024, giving a presentation on “Model Extraction: Why You Should Care and How to Protect Yourself.” This topic is important for understanding the risks of AI model extraction and how to protect against it.***

GenerationAI was more than just a technical conference. It sparked important conversations about the social, environmental, and philosophical issues related to AI.

Indeed, AI needs gradient descent, GPU power, training epochs, fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, loss function optimization, and many other technical things.

**But AI also needs:**

-   **Psychology** - Do we love LLMs because they confirm our own confirmation biases?
    
-   **Literature -** How can writing help us imagine what we want and what we do not want from our AI use?
    
-   **Philosophy** - Is AI at our service, by providing data insights into our life (after all, we can only improve what we measure), or are we at the service of AI, feeding the tech giants with every aspect of our life?
    
-   **Politics** - Should the hyperpersonalization pushed by AI reflect on public policies?
    
-   **Environmental sciences** - Is AI always worth its environmental cost? Can AI help us fight climate change?
    

These questions don’t have definitive answers, but they’ve sparked some really interesting debates, with best-in-class speakers!
The technical aspect of AI was not left behind of course, with amazing sessions mixing GenAI, computer vision and on-device AI.
We’re honored to have been part of this event, it was a huge success!
